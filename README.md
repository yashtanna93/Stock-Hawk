# Stock-Hawk
This application is a project which is a part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree Program where the task was to productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. It involved finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.
